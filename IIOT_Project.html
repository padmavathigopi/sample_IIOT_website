        <h1 style="color:black;align-items:center;justify-content:center;display:flex;"> IIoT vs IoT</h1><br>
    <span class="text-muted text-center">The differences between these technologies lies less in how they work and more in how they are used. The bulk of the world’s IoT solutions tend to have individuals<br>
         as their end users and are most commonly incorporated into things like smart watches, voice-controlled digital assistants, or smart appliances and TVs.<br>
        IIoT is a subset of IoT, and, while it is driven by the same basic technologies, its focus is much more on automation and efficiency across an entire, connected organizational ecosystem – as opposed to an isolated user. <br>
        In IIoT networks, gathering and curating data is only the first step in a more
     complex process. To provide maximum benefit to a business, artificial intelligence and<br> machine learning must be applied to that data to deliver accurate insights and to optimize workflows and automated tasks. Human users must also be able <br>
     to interact with these devices as seamlessly 
        as possible to create cyber-physical networks in which the best of human and technological abilities can augment each other.</span><br><br><br>
       <h1 style="color:black;align-items:center;justify-content:center;display:flex;">  Next steps to an IIoT transformation</h1><br><br><br>
    <span class="text-muted text-center">
        A successful business transformation relies upon good change management strategies and a commitment to regular and meaningful communication across the business. 
        Building an IIoT network does not have to happen overnight. It can start with a modern cloud ERP to help you centralize and unify your business operations
        and build gradually as you connect and integrate smart devices, smart teams, and smart systems. <br><br><br>

    <span class="text-muted text-center">For an IIoT network to be effective, it must do two essential things:<br> connect devices and
         assets to each other and a central system; and <br>make it possible for the data they gather and transmit to be stored, managed, analyzed, and put to good use.
    </span><br><br>
    <span class="text-muted text-center">To do so, IIoT networks rely on the following technologies:</span><br><br>
    <div>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Connectivity (and 5G):</b> IIoT networks need the capacity to send and receive the massive volumes of data generated by machines and devices. >
            This has traditionally been both enabled and limited by the power of Wi-Fi connectivity. But 5G and other advances in cellular networks are changing this calculus,
             increasing bandwidth to manage larger data sets, while also reducing latency and power consumption. These characteristics can support
             a greater number of devices capable of sending and receiving signals faster for more efficient data processing and longer battery life.  </li><br>
            <li><b>IIoT sensors:</b>Today, sensors are typically built into new industrial equipment and machinery.  But analog machinery and manufacturing equipment can also be
             fitted with IoT gateway devices such as cameras and gauges. This lets IIoT assets detect conditions in their environment, including the proximity of other objects, air pressure 
             or humidity – as well as motor speed, fluid levels, and other mechanical conditions. All of this information can then 
            be processed locally to inform real-time actions or be transmitted to a central system (such as an ERP) via the cloud for advanced analysis.</li><br>

</section>
<section id="id2">
    <p>Industrial IoT systems are made powerful by connected devices and machines that can speak the same language, monitor
        and analyze industrial performance data, and allow real-time visibility into what’s going right, what’s going wrong,
        and even predictions on when something will go wrong. A connected IIoT ecosystem gives you and your team the power to enhance efficiencies
         remotely monitor, benchmark across sites, maximize uptime, optimize operations in factory and field—the potential is limitless.<br>

  <span class="text-muted"> <i>The biggest benefit of IIoT is that it gives manufacturers the ability to automate, and therefore optimize
         their operating efficiency. Robotics and automated machinery can work more efficiently and accurately, boosting 
         productivity and helping manufacturers streamline their functions.Additionally, physical machinery can be connected to software
          via sensors that monitor performance on a constant basis. This enables manufacturers to have better insights into the operational 
        performance of individual pieces of equipment as well as entire fleets.IIoT-enabled data systems empower manufacturers to improve operating efficiencies</i></span>
